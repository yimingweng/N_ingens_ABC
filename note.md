This note is part of "Hybrid Speciation Project", describing the work of detecting historical introgression from *N. ingens* and/or *N. riversi* to the hybrid populations. The main goal is to prove that the occurrence of historical hybridization.  

1. Because this work is to detect the admixture event between *N. riversi* and *N. ingens*, we only focus on the summary statistics that are sensitive to admixture
2. Two models are considered, and the simulation with be based on this two models, and the ABC approach will be performed to find the better model.

3. I use [msprime](https://tskit.dev/msprime/docs/latest/intro.html) to simulate the data:
